# Plan-It!

This is a project I am creating for CPE 305: Individual Software Design and Development.  

I am creating a website designed to make planning large events much easier.  It will allow users to easily create and share events with their guests and organize what everyone is bringing, calculate the amount of money each person owes, and assign carpools in a single all-inclusive website.  The main goal of the website is to dispose of the difficult organizational tasks of planning an event.
